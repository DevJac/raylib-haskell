* TODOs
** DONE Check latest raylib version
CLOSED: [2018-11-02 Fri 15:14]
2.0.0 is the latest version, this is the version we already have in the repo.
** TODO Review c2hs docs
** TODO Review Storable typeclass
** TODO Review haddock format
** TODO Should haddocks go in the Internal files or the higher level?
Ideally the haddocks could go into the Internal chs file and then be used for higher level docs. This way the haddocks are closer to the relevant code.
** DONE Come up with testing plan
CLOSED: [2018-11-02 Fri 15:22]
We need a MVP test case. Something that will test a few of the more complex function calls in raylib.
* Test case
** Plan
Setup window.

Draw a rectangle with DrawRectangleRec which will require creating a Rectangle and Color struct.

Load an image and draw it.

Repeat the above steps many times and watch for memory leaks.
** Bindings we need
- [X] InitWindow
- [ ] Color struct
- [ ] Rectangle struct
- [ ] DrawRectangleRec

- [X] CloseWindow
- [ ] LoadImage or variant
- [ ] Image struct
* Storable example
Remember: there is a Vector2 struct in raylib.h

data Vector2 = Vector2 Float Float

instance Storable Vector2 where
    sizeOf = const {# sizeof Vector2 #}
    alignment = const {# alignof Vector2 #}
    peek p = do
        x <- realToFrac <$> {# get Vector2.x #} p
        y <- realToFrac <$> {# get Vector2.y #} p
        pure $ Vector2 x y
    poke p (Vector2 x y) = do
        {# set Vector2.x #} p (realToFrac x)
        {# set Vector2.y #} p (realToFrac y)
